This is a repo for hosting a fieldwork best practices document initially created by the [International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration](https://thwaitesglacier.org/)'s committee for [Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Antiracism](https://thwaitesglacier.org/about/diversity).

The document is hosted publicly here: [https://ldeo-glaciology.github.io/ITGC-field-doc/](https://ldeo-glaciology.github.io/ITGC-field-doc/).

This is intended to be an ongoing collaborative effort across the polar science community.
